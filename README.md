# Company-X-case-study

In 2018, I was invited for an interview after completion of a practical assesment to demonstrate my ability for practical tasks entailed by the job offer from company X. 

The practical assesment was to be done using MS-Excel, which I did successfully. I recently stumbled on the assessment and decided to replicate it using R.

The Instructions are as follows:
1. Complete the following tasks in the sheet named "Job Titles"
a) Create Job Titles in column F. All job titles should be in the format- specialization + rank, department. Exceptions to this rule:
i. If department is Executive or rank starts contains the word ""Chief"", just use specialization + rank
ii. If rank has the words ""Lead"" or ""Senior"", these should prefix the job title
iii. If specialization is ""Project Management"", job title format is inverted i.e. starts with rank + specialization, department
iv. If department contains the word ""Leadership"", replace department with group in the job title"											

2. Which job title is the most common across all territories?

3. Which territory has the least job titles assigned?

4. Now, look at the teacher data in the ""Academy Staff Rooster"" sheet
i. How many active teachers does Company X have for each job title?
ii. What is the age of each teacher?
iii. What is the median age of male emppoyees vs female?
iv. On average, which academy has the youngest employees, which has the oldest
v. What other inferences can you make from this dataset? "
